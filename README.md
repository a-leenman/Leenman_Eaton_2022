# Leenman_Eaton_2022
R code used to generate all figures in the manuscript: Leenman, A.S. and Eaton, B.C. (submitted) Episodic sediment supply to alluvial fans: implications for fan incision and morphometry. *Submitted to Earth Surface Dynamics (ESurf)*. I'll update with a doi when its been assigned. 

I wrote the code as an R Markdown document. All the figures are exported to files rather than the output html file, so I haven't included the "knitted" html as there are no figures in it. There are also two short scripts for figures/analysis I added for the final revision of my PhD.
