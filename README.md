# Leenman_Eaton_2022
R code used to generate all figures in the manuscript: Leenman, A.S. and Eaton, B.C. (submitted) Episodic sediment supply to alluvial fans: implications for fan incision and morphometry. *Submitted to Earth Surface Dynamics (ESurf)*. I'll update with a doi when its been assigned. 

This time I wrote *most* of the code as a single R Markdown document so things should be easy-ish to follow. 

I've included both the R code and the associated html output file. There are also two short scripts for figures/analysis I added for the final revision of my PhD.
